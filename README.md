* No Screenshots - No one can take Screenshots.
* More upcoming...ðŸ”¥

# Tech
* Python Django Web Framework
* HTML / CSS / Javascript
* Ajax
* JQuery
* Mysql lite

# Benefits of this project
* By restricting files can prevent 70% of fake news by spreading it so better control.
* By restricting the download of the files we can save storage and prevent unethical access of documents.
* By restricting screenshots makes it more secure.

This is not a total complete project like all the features mentioned here are already implemented but it's just a start and we'll continue to update this project.


# What's the concept that makes this project different?
HeyðŸ‘‹, take one scenario assume I'm fenal sending a message to my friend Viraj but I don't want to allow Viraj to forward that message, to the next person, right? but I can say it to Viraj but it's up to him and if he forwards that message to a third person it's up to him we wouldn't know. Don't you think that might cause a serious problem?

Now what's the solution?
The solution is this CUDSS system. This project implemented that kind of mechanism that prevents this problem where the sender can decide whether the receiver has permission to forward your messages further or not. If you have given receiver the permission then the receiver can forward your messages to a third person.

And the interesting part is that assume you've shared some fake message and at that moment you didn't know and that message has been spread to 10,000 people (assumption). Now, you got to know that message you've shared was fake and causing trouble so you can select the option called '**Stop Forwarding**' no matter till now the message has been spread to how many users will not be able to forward to other users. Isn't it interesting?

There are also a few minor feature regular features like no copy, no screenshots, and no download but the main feature I've explained is not till now 14-July 2023 implemented in any social media chat application.
